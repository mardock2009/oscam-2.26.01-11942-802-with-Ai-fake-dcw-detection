# Accessibility Support in Trac

Not every user has a graphic environment with a mouse or other pointing device. Some users rely on a keyboard, alternative keyboard or voice input to navigate links and activate form controls. In a Trac session, users can use a device other than a pointing device by enabling keyboard shortcuts through the [Keyboard Shortcuts](https://trac.streamboard.tv/oscam/prefs/userinterface) preferences panel.

## Global Access Keys

The global access keys differ by browser and the following work for several browsers:

+   on Linux, press any of the keys listed below in combination with the `<Alt>` key
+   on a Mac, use `<Ctrl>` + `<Opt>` + `<Key>`
+   on Windows, use `<Shift> + <Alt> + <Key>`. This works for the most common browsers, such as Firefox, Chrome, Safari and Internet Explorer

See [​access in different browsers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Access_key#Access_in_different_browsers "Access_key in WikiPedia") for more details.

## [TracBrowser](https://trac.streamboard.tv/oscam/wiki/TracBrowser) Navigation

The browser can be navigated using the keys listed below. The key modifiers listed above are not used for navigating the browser.

+   `j` and `k` - select the next or previous entry, starting with the first
+   `o` (**o**pen) - toggle between expanded and collapsed state of the selected directory or visit the selected file
+   `v` (**v**iew, **v**isit) and `<Enter>` - same as above
+   `r` - **r**eload an already expanded directory
+   `a` - directly visit a file in **a**nnotate (blame) mode
+   `L` - view the **L**og for the selected entry

If no row has been selected using `j` or `k`, the keys will operate on the entry under the mouse.
