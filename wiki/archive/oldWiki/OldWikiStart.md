# OldWikiStart

Trac is a *minimalistic* approach to *web-based* management of
*software projects*. Its goal is to simplify effective tracking and handling of software issues, enhancements and overall progress.

All aspects of Trac have been designed with the single goal to
*help developers write great software* while *staying out of the way*
and imposing as little as possible on a team's established process and
culture.

As all Wiki pages, this page is editable, this means that you can
modify the contents of this page simply by using your
web-browser. Simply click on the "Edit this page" link at the bottom
of the page. WikiFormatting will give you a detailed description of
available Wiki formatting commands.

"[trac-admin](./TracAdmin) _yourenvdir_ initenv" created
a new Trac environment, containing a default set of wiki pages and some sample
data. This newly created environment also contains
[documentation](./TracGuide) to help you get started with your project.

You can use [trac-admin](./TracAdmin) to configure
[Trac](http://trac.edgewall.org/) to better fit your project, especially in
regard to _components_, _versions_ and _milestones_.


TracGuide is a good place to start.

Enjoy!
